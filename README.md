# Sim racing rating system

This project is trying to import rFactor 2 XML files and generate a database of drivers, with a very basic safety rating system (inspired by iRacing)

It's a React app so you'll have to use the usual React commands to run it

* `yarn start` - Runs the app in the development mode
